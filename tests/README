# Running tests

## Environment Variables

All the necessary environment variables are set in the `.env.test` file.
You can copy the `.env.example.test` file and fill in the necessary values.

## Running tests

The tests are run using the `pytest` library through the `tox` library.
To run the tests, you can use the following command:

```bash
tox -e test
```

This will run the tests from the library.

If you want to run all the `tox` environments, you can use the following command:

```bash
# You can optionally add the run-parallel flag to run the tests in parallel
tox [run-parallel]
```
